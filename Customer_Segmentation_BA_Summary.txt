Project 2: Customer Segmentation using RFM and K-Means

Business Objective:
The marketing team wants to reduce budget waste by sending personalized campaigns instead of generic offers to all customers. However, they currently lack a clear understanding of different customer groups.

Business Problem:
The company has:
- A large customer base with varied behavior
- No data-driven method to segment customers
- Poor ROI from "one-size-fits-all" campaigns
- High churn and low reactivation from past buyers

The leadership needs a customer segmentation model that enables:
- Personalized email/discount campaigns
- Focus on high-value and at-risk customers
- Strategic planning for retention and upsell

üîç Solution Approach (Business Analyst Perspective):
We used RFM analysis to quantify customer value:
- Recency: How recently they purchased
- Frequency: How often they purchased
- Monetary: How much they spent

Then we applied K-Means Clustering to group customers into 4 clear segments based on these behaviors.

Steps Taken:
1. Cleaned purchase data (removed nulls, returns, invalid entries)
2. Created RFM features for each customer
3. Standardized data for clustering
4. Used Elbow Method to find best number of segments (k)
5. Applied K-Means to cluster customers
6. Profiled clusters and gave business-level labels (e.g. VIPs, At-Risk)
7. Suggested marketing actions for each segment

Example Output: Segment Profiles

Cluster | Recency | Frequency | Monetary | Label         | Action
--------|---------|-----------|----------|---------------|-------------------------------
0       | Low     | High      | High     | VIP Customers | Loyalty offers, early access
1       | High    | Low       | Low      | At-Risk       | Win-back campaigns
2       | Medium  | Medium    | Medium   | Regular       | Keep engaged with updates
3       | Low     | Low       | Low      | New Buyers    | Educate and nurture

 How This Solves the Problem:
- Gave the marketing team clear customer segments
- Enabled tailored campaigns, boosting engagement
- Allowed retention planning for at-risk customers
- Improved marketing efficiency and ROI
